// Aggregate is an interface representing a versioned data entity created from
// events. It receives commands and generates evens that are stored.

// The aggregate is created/loaded and saved by the Repository inside the
// Dispatcher. A domain specific aggregate can either imlement the full interface,
// or more commonly embed *AggregateBase to take care of the common methods.

// The embedded aggregate is then initialized by the factory function in the
